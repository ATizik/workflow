/**
 * Represents a unit of asynchronous work that can have zero, one, or multiple outputs.
 *
 * [Worker]s are effectively [Flow]s that can be compared to determine equivalence.
 *
 * A [Workflow] uses [Worker]s to perform asynchronous work during the render pass by calling
 * [RenderContext.onWorkerOutput] or [RenderContext.runningWorker]. When equivalent [Worker]s are
 * passed in subsequent render passes, [doesSameWorkAs] is used to calculate which [Worker]s are
 * new and should be started, and which ones are continuations from the last render pass and
 * should be allowed to continue working. [Worker]s that are not included in a render pass are
 * cancelled.
 *
 * ## Example: Network request
 *
 * Let's say you have a network service with an API that returns a number, and you want to
 * call that service from a [Workflow].
 *
 * ```
 * interface TimeService {
 *   suspend fun getTime(timezone: String): Long
 * }
 * ```
 *
 * The first step is to define a [Worker] that can call this service, and maybe an extension
 * function on your service class:
 * ```
 * fun TimeService.getTimeWorker(timezone: String): Worker<Long> = TimeWorker(timezone, this)
 *
 * private class TimeWorker(
 *   val timezone: String,
 *   val service: TimeService
 * ): Worker<Long> {
 *
 *   override fun run(): Flow<Long> = flow {
 *     val time = service.getTime(timezone)
 *     emit(time)
 *   }
 * }
 * ```
 *
 * You also need to define how to determine if a previous [Worker] is already doing the same work.
 * This will ensure that if the same request is made by the same [Workflow] in adjacent render
 * passes, we'll keep the request alive from the first pass.
 * ```
 *   override fun doesSameWorkAs(otherWorker: Worker<*>): Boolean =
 *     otherWorker is TimeWorker &&
 *       timezone == otherWorker.timezone
 * ```
 *
 * Now you can request the time from your [Workflow]:
 * ```
 * class MyWorkflow(private val timeWorker: TimeWorker) {
 *   override fun render(…): Foo {
 *     context.onWorkerOutput(timeWorker) { time -> emitOutput("The time is $time") }
 *   }
 * ```
 *
 * Alternatively, if the response is a unique type, unlikely to be shared by any other workers,
 * you don't even need to create your own [Worker] class, you can use a builder, and the worker
 * will automatically be distinguished by that response type:
 * ```
 * interface TimeService {
 *   fun getTime(timezone: String): Deferred<TimeResponse>
 * }
 *
 * fun TimeService.getTimeWorker(timezone: String): Worker<TimeResponse> =
 *   Worker.from { getTime(timezone).await()) }
 * ```
 *
 * @see create
 * @see from
 * @see fromNullable
 * @see Deferred.asWorker
 * @see BroadcastChannel.asWorker

   * At the end of every render pass, the set of [Worker]s that were requested by the workflow are

   * to keep running. New workers are started ([run] is called and the returned [Flow] is
   * collected). Old workers are cancelled by cancelling their collecting coroutines.
   *
   * Implementations of this method should not be based on object identity. For example, a [Worker]
   * that performs a network request might check that two workers are requests to the same endpoint
   * and have the same request data.
   *
   * Most implementations of this method will check for concrete type equality, and then match
   * on constructor parameters.
